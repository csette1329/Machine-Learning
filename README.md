# Machine Learning
Welcome to my personal Machine Learning repository! Here you will find a collection of python projects that demonstrate my skills and expertise in Machine Learning and predictive analytics.

## About Me
I am a passionate data enthusiast with a strong background in transforming raw data into meaningful insights, creating interactive dashboards, and helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## [Project 1] Predicting movies IMDB ratings
This model is simple but yet had a decent accuracy for predicting movies IMDB ratings based on the features ['Metascore','Budget','Worldwide_Gross'].

## [Project 3] Exploring Predictions on Customer Complaints using Logistic Regression and Neural Networks
In this project, my team and I analysed a dataset consisting of costumer complaints and created a model to classify each complaint.

<b> Model 1: Logistic Regressor </b>
Not very accurate for some classes.

<b>Model 2: Sequential Neural Network with 1 hidden layer</b>

- Improved reliability for some classes but not very effective.

<b>Model 3: Sequential Neural Network  with 3 hidden layers</b>
- Not much improvement and overfitting starts to become more noticeable.
